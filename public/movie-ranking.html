<h1>The Best Anime According to Hamoric</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Anime of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. I love the world this anime is set in and how extensive the lore is.</p>
<h3>Full Metal Alchamist Brotherhood</h3>
<p> Probably one of the most perfect anime out there. The story, the animation, and the philosophical themes are all chef's kiss.</p>
<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>Amazing animation and one of the best power systems in all of anime.</p>
